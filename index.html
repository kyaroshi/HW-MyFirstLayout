                 <p>After working in tech as a content marketing & communication specialist for a few years, I decided to readjust my 
                    career path and get into UX. I believe my skills and previous experiences are positively adding to my UX practice.</p>
                    
                 <p>Through my Master’s in Anthropology, I learned that I was passionate about understanding and advocating
                    for people.</p>
                    
                 <p>Through my previous career, I learned that I thoroughly enjoyed finding creative solutions to problems and 
                    communicating them in an efficient manner.</p>

                <div class="parksProject"><p>Parks are one of the best thing about San Francisco and its park system is recognized to be one of the best in the US. In a city where space is
                        a luxury, parks are a way for residents and visitors to reappropriate public spaces. The current website does not give a good digital identity to
                        the park system, which is ironic considering we are located in tech haven.  It also isn’t fully accessible as the color contrasts are not high enough in
                        the navigation bar, on the subtitles and on the hyperlinks, which could get the department in a lot of trouble.</p>
                        
                <p>The Recreation and Parks department deserves a more pleasingly functioning website so it serves its users better.</p></div>

                <p>Out of a few tasks, I decided to focus on redesigning the path to find a specific park on the site because the users I tested had to resort to using the search bar to find what they were looking for.</p>
                <p>This is due to the fact the path isn’t directly available through the subitems on the navigation bar and that the “Find a destination page” doesn’t indicate a clear way to the Parks Index page. I decided to redesign this whole flow. </p>

                <p>1. Adding a “Parks” item in the 1st category of the primary navigation bar as well as focus on places people might want to browse for.</p>
                    
                <p> 2. A complete recategorization of the subitems in the “Recreation & Services” category to allow for easier activity browsing.</p>
                    
                <p>3. Changing the name of the 4th category to reflect the environmental and community enhancement mission.</p>

                <p>I changed the orientation of the navigation bar to make it easier to scan.

                <p>The upper navigation bar became action buttons as users completely missed it during the tests. </p>
                <p>I decided to limit the number of items visible on the homepage to only a few. Users found that it was overwhelming to look at the homepage before of all the content available.</p>

                    <p>I made the Parks Index page card-based to be easier to browse and hid all the filter options in a filter button.</P> 

                    <p>The cards also show some of the main elements a user might be looking for when browsing for a park. </p>

            <div class="sevenRight">
                <p>One of the most striking comment a user made during the preliminary tests was that the park’s page didn’t spark any excitement as to visiting the park and they didn’t know where to look for the information they wanted to see. </p>

                <p> I made sure to utilize the whole page width and leave enough white space between the content cards to make it digestible and catch the attention of the website’s users. </p>
